Some notes on fabric tasks:

== Running ==
- you need fabric installed
- you need python-foreman installed


== Config ==
There are some default configuration values defined in the config.py file, you
can override them using parameters but you have to look at the code to see the
parameters name and which methods use them.


== Using parallel execution ==
- Use execute ONLY in the most outer task, and it has to be decorated with
  runs_once. To use another tasks inside other tasks, include the module and
  call the method directly.

- Make sure that all the tasks that must not be runned in parallel are
  decorated with serial


== Some examples (may be outdated, be warned) ==

- Using host ranges:
    > fab hostrange:myhost1:15,myhost17 -- echo "\$(hostname)"

- Add packages in parallel:
    > fab -P hostrange:myhost1:15 yum.pkgs:puppet

- Copy a file to all the hosts (matching the content):
    > fab -H myhost1,myhost12 file.ensure_content:local.conf,/etc/remote.conf

- Add already existing hosts to foreman, installing puppet if necessary and in
  parallel mode:
    > fab -P hostrange:myhost1:35 \
    .. foreman.setup_host:frm_user=myuser,frm_pass=s3cr3T
  Note that the frm_user and pass are the user and pass to the foreman web ui.

- Sync all the machines time with default ntp server:
    > fab hostrange:myhost1:10 system.ntp.sync

To see all the options use fab -l, and to see the possible parameters enter
inside the code (sorry, on the todo list)
